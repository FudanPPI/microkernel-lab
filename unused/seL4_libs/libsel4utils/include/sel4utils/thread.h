 *                    ie. jumping to this start symbol will work:

 *                    decrement the stack value to account for this.
 *
 *                    ie.

 *                         call main

 *
 *

 * @param arg1        another pointer. User decides the protocol. Note that there are two args here
 *                    to easily support C standard: int main(int argc, char **argv).
