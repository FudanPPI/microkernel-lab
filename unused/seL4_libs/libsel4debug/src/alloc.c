/* This file contains functionality for debugging heap corruption issues. It is
 * styled after Electric Fence [0], but we can't check as thoroughly as eFence
 * can because we don't have support for mapping/unmapping/mprotecting regions.
 * The basic concept is that we stick a 'canary' value before and after
 * allocated memory. During free, we check that these canaries haven't been
 * overwritten, which would imply buffer underflow or overflow. This checking
 * is limited in that we don't catch heap corruption until memory is actually
 * freed.
 *
 * Essentially any allocated region actually looks like this:
 *   p           q         r
 *   ↓           ↓         ↓
 *   |canary|size|memory...|canary|
 *
 * Internally we deal in 'unboxed' pointers, like p. Externally the caller is
 * given 'boxed' pointers, like q. We effectively play the same tricks malloc
 * does to store some book keeping information surrounding the malloced memory.
 * The 'size' stored is the size the user requested, not the size including
 * the canaries etc. We need to track this in order to calculate the pointer r
 * on free.
 *
 * In addition to checking for corruption within the heap, this functionality
 * also tracks pointers that have been allocated. If you try and free (or
 * realloc) a pointer that was never allocated, it will be detected.
 *
 * To use this, you will need to instruct the linker to wrap your calls to
 * allocation functions. You will need to append something like the following
 * to your LD_FALGS:
 *  -Wl,--wrap=malloc -Wl,--wrap=free -Wl,--wrap=realloc -Wl,--wrap=calloc
 *
 * Ensure you do not call any functions that malloc or free memory within this
 * file or you will infinitely recurse.
